## Overview

This project is a 3D rendition of the classic Pacman game, implemented with OpenGL for graphics rendering.

## Features

- **First Person Perspective:** Immerse yourself in the game with a first-person perspective, putting you right in the heart of the action.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Experience dynamic lighting effects, including glow-in-the-dark objects and a flashlight feature that adds an extra layer of suspense.
- **Changing Wall Scheme:** Enjoy a unique experience in each game with a unique wall scheme for every playthrough using Prim's Algorithm.
- **Ghost Behavior:** Challenge yourself with intelligent ghost behavior powered by the BFS Algorithm where ghosts find the shortest path from their current position to you.
- **Minimap:** Stay oriented with a 2D minimap displayed as a second render which provides a bird's-eye view of the maze layout, helping you navigate more effectively.
- **Powerups:** Take a break by consuming a powerup that temporarily disables the ghosts, giving you a window of opportunity to outmaneuver them and continue your pursuit of victory.
- **Music:** Immerse yourself in an atmospheric sonic experience that complements the thrilling gameplay. 

Reach 1000 points to secure victory. Be cautious not to get caught by the ghosts, as being captured will result in defeat.
